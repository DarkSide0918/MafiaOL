# MafiaOL

Welcome! 
MafiaOL is an indie, temporarily open-source software developed by @DarkSide0918! 

There is nothing in the main branch right now. Everything as of progress is in the init branch and some other branches used to sync progress. I will pull everything into the main branch after entering beta or maybe even on the 1.0 release. This software will be most likely open source before release, but cannot be guaranteed. 

If you are intersted in working with me in the development of this software, please contact me with the following email address: 
DarkSide0918@pm.me
I will send you a confirmation email no matter if you are accepted after I received your email, then we can work on adding you into the team and such from there. Please allow up to 48 hours after sending the email request. If you did not receive a responce from me within 48 hours, contact me by discord. Thanks!
